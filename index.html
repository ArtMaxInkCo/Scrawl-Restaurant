                        It was thought that to drink alcohol was to live a life shadowed by death; that those who
                        drank
                        were keeping company with death. It's taken us nearly a century to restore flavor to the
                        drink
                        and class to the specialty cocktail. In our time, a night to celebrate life's simple

                        with fine wine, exquisitely crafted cocktails, beautifully prepared food, and impeccable

                        spirits is a rare gift.

                        clock,
                        which he bought at the world exhibition in the capital of France. Also brought from Paris

                        Palace of Princess Eugenia of Oldenburg, which, unfortunately, has not survived to this day.
                        Both
                        buildings together constituted a single architectural ensemble.
