                        It was thought that to drink alcohol was to live a life shadowed by death; that those who
                        drank
                        were keeping company with death. It's taken us nearly a century to restore flavor to the
                        drink
                        and class to the specialty cocktail. In our time, a night to celebrate life's simple

                        with fine wine, exquisitely crafted cocktails, beautifully prepared food, and impeccable

                        Story
                        most famous restaurant started over a century ago. In 1902, the founder of the MMMM resort
                        prince
                        Alexander of Someones brought to Somewhere a disassembled wooden building with
                        clock,
                        which he bought at the world exhibition in the capital of France. Also brought from Paris
                        building
                        for
                        Palace of Princess Eugenia of Someones, which, unfortunately, has not survived to this day.
                        Both
                        buildings together constituted a single architectural ensemble.
